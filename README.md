# Monte Carlo Simulation
- Financial data was extracted from Yahoo finance.
- Cleaned, Scaled and Removed the NaN values.
- Used Monte Carlo Simulation to Simulate the direction a of South African Stocks Portfolio.
- Stocks ticker invloved were NTC, SSW, RBP, AMS, APN and FSR.  
- I chose to have 10 000 simulations for the period of 90 days.
- In which were enough to give an idea of how the portfolio might perform.
- We also caclulated the VaR and CVar. 
- These measures gives an prediction on how much our portfolio might lose in a period of 90 days.
