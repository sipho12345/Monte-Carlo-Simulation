# In this project we used Monte Carlo Simulation to Simulate the direction of an Asset, this includes 10 000 simulations in which the direction of an asset might go, we also calulated the VaR and CVar, to get Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk.
# We also used linear regression to compare a single asset to the market to get Alpha which is an indicate of an asset performance to market performance(for example AMZN stock to the whole S&P500)
